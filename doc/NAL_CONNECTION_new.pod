=head1 DESCRIPTION

NAL_CONNECTION_new() allocates and initialises a new B<NAL_CONNECTION> object.

NAL_CONNECTION_free() destroys a B<NAL_CONNECTION> object.

NAL_CONNECTION_create() will attempt to connect to the address represented by
B<addr>. If this succeeds, it means either that the underlying connection of
B<conn> is established, or that a non-blocking connect was successfully
initiated but has not yet completed (it may still be rejected by the peer
eventually). Typically, unix domain sockets connect or fail immediately, and
usually TCP/IPv4 connect non-blocking, though this may not be true for some
interfaces such as `localhost'. It should generally be assumed that the
connection is in progress if this function succeeds. The size of the
connection's underlying read and send B<NAL_BUFFER>s is initialised to the
default that was created in B<addr>. See the L<NOTES> section for more
discussion of connection semantics.

NAL_CONNECTION_create_pair() will initialise B<conn1> and B<conn2> to be
end-points of a single connection. This is typically implemented using the
socketpair(2) function, and is designed to allow for an IPC mechanism that
integrates with I<libnal>. B<def_buffer_size> will control the size of the read
and send buffers of both connections if the functions succeed. See the
L<EXAMPLES> section for some uses of ``pairs''.

NAL_CONNECTION_create_dummy() will implement a virtual FIFO that has no
underlying network resource associated with it. Writing data to the connection
amounts to pushing data onto the front of the FIFO, and reading data from the
connection amounts to popping data off the end of the FIFO. The size of the
FIFO is specified by B<def_buffer_size>. See the L<BUGS> section for a note
on using these connection types with B<NAL_SELECTOR>.

NAL_CONNECTION_set_size() will resize the read and send buffers of B<conn> to
B<size>. The default size of those buffers is inherited from the setting
created in the B<NAL_ADDRESS> that initialised B<conn>, or if B<conn> was
accepted from a B<NAL_LISTENER> object, then from the address that created the
listener. The individual buffers can be resized independantly by using the
following two functions to obtain the buffesr and using B<NAL_BUFFER> functions
directly.

NAL_CONNECTION_get_read() and NAL_CONNECTION_get_send() return the read and send
buffers of B<conn>. This is how reading and writing is performed on B<conn>, as
B<NAL_BUFFER> functions may be used on these buffers directly.

NAL_CONNECTION_io() will perform any network input/output that is possible
given the state in B<sel>. Unless B<conn> had been added to B<sel> via
NAL_SELECTOR_add_conn() (or its `_ex' variant) and a resulting call to
NAL_SELECTOR_select() had revealed readability and/or writability on B<conn>,
this function will silently succeed. Otherwise it will attempt to perform
whatever reading or writing was required. If this function fails, that
indicates that the connection is no longer valid - this represents a
disconnection by the peer, the result of a non-blocking connect that had been
initiated but was unable to connect, or some network error that makes B<conn>
unusable. See the L<NOTES> section.

NAL_CONNECTION_io_cap() is a version of NAL_CONNECTION_io() that allows the
caller to specify a limit on the maximum amount B<conn> should read from, or
send to, the network. Whether this amount is read or sent (or even whether
reading or sending takes place at all) depends on; the data (and space)
available is in the connection's buffers, what the results of the last select
on B<sel> were, and how much data the host system's networking support will
accept or provide to B<conn>.

NAL_CONNECTION_address() returns a pointer to B<conn>'s internal copy of the
B<NAL_ADDRESS> object that it was created from.

NAL_CONNECTION_is_established() is almost useful for determining when a
non-blocking connect has completed, but the L<BUGS> section explains why it
doesn't yet work in the general case.

NAL_CONNECTION_get_fd() returns the integer file-descriptor underlying B<conn>,
or a negative value if B<conn> has no such thing.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

NAL_CONNECTION_new() returns a valid B<NAL_CONNECTION> object on success, NULL
otherwise.

NAL_CONNECTION_free() has no return value.

NAL_CONNECTION_get_read() and NAL_CONNECTION_get_send() return pointers to the
connection's buffer objects or NULL for failure.

NAL_CONNECTION_address() returns a pointer to B<conn>'s internal copy of the
B<NAL_ADDRESS> object that it was created from (which should not be manipulated
or destroyed by the caller), or NULL for failure.

All other B<NAL_CONNECTION> functions return zero for failure or false, and
non-zero for success or true.

=head1 NOTES

A B<NAL_CONNECTION> object encapsulates two B<NAL_BUFFER> objects and a
non-blocking socket. Any data that has been read from the socket is placed in
the read buffer, and applications write data into the send buffer for it to be
(eventually) written out to the socket. The B<NAL_SELECTOR> type provides the
ability to poll for any requested network events and then allow connections and
listeners to perform their network input/output based on the results. The
encapsulation provided by NAL_SELECTOR_add_conn() and NAL_CONNECTION_io() uses
the following logic; the connection is always selected for exception events and
if one occurs, the following call to NAL_CONNECTION_io() will fail. If the
connection's read buffer is not full, the connection is selected for
readability and if the selector indicates the connection is readable, the
following I/O call will read any available incoming data up to the limit of the
available space in the buffer.  Finally, the connection is selected for
writability if the the connection's send buffer is not empty, and if the
selector indicates writability, the following I/O call will send as much of the
send buffer's data as the network support will accept.

It should be noted that the actual transport in use is virtualised to allow for
multiple transports and, because of this, multiple semantics for how the
network functionality behaves. For TCP/IPv4 and unix domain socket based
connections, as well as connection pairs from NAL_CONNECTION_create_pair(),
operate very much as described here. The FIFO connection type, created by
NAL_CONNECTION_create_dummy() is not yet consistent with this and is described
in the L<BUGS> section.

=head1 BUGS

In the current implementation, non-blocking connects are never genuinely
checked for being successfully completed or not. Under sane systems, a
non-blocking connect that fails is noticable by the fact that the connection
will appear immediately readable and writable (so should return from any
NAL_SELECTOR_select() call) and will fail any subsequent NAL_CONNECTION_io()
call. Put another way, a failed non-blocking connect is indistinguishable from
a non-blocking connect being accepted by the peer then immediately
disconnected. This is not such a bad ambiguity.

An issue that is less appealing is that a successful non-blocking connect
triggers no event and the NAL_CONNECTION_is_established() function does not
actually tell us this connection status, it continues to tell us the connection
is not established until at least one byte of data has been successfully read
from, or sent to, the connection.

=head1 EXAMPLES

A typical state-machine implementation using a single connection is illustrated
here (without error-checking);

    NAL_BUFFER *c_read, *c_send;
    NAL_SELECTOR *sel = NAL_SELECTOR_new();
    NAL_CONNECTION *conn = NAL_CONNECTION_new();
    NAL_ADDRESS *addr = retrieve_the_desired_address();

    /* Setup */
    NAL_CONNECTION_create(conn, addr);
    c_read = NAL_CONNECTION_get_read(conn);
    c_send = NAL_CONNECTION_get_send(conn);

    /* Loop */
    do {
	/* This is where the state-machine code should process as much data
	 * from 'c_read' and produce as much output to 'c_send' as it can. */
        ...
	... user code
	...
	/* Prepare to block on (relevant) network events for 'conn' */
	NAL_SELECTOR_add_conn(sel, conn);
	/* Do network I/O after the above blocking select and continue looping
	 * only if the connection is still alive. */
    } while(NAL_CONNECTION_io(conn, sel);

An example of using a connection pair (with 2 Kb read and send buffers for each
connection) to create IPC between a parent process and its child (again, no
error checking);

    NAL_CONNECTION *ipc_to_parent = NAL_CONNECTION_new();
    NAL_CONNECTION *ipc_to_child = NAL_CONNECTION_new();

    /* Setup */
    NAL_CONNECTION_create_pair(ipc_to_parent, ipc_to_child, 2048);

    /* Create child process */
    switch(fork()) {
        case 0:
	    /* Inside the child process, close our copy of the parent's side */
	    NAL_CONNECTION_free(ipc_to_child);
	    /* Do child process things using 'ipc_to_parent' to communicate
	     * with the parent. */
	    do_child_logic(ipc_to_parent);
	    ...
	default:
	    /* Inside the parent process, close our copy of the child's side */
	    NAL_CONNECTION_free(ipc_to_parent);
	    break;
    }
    /* Continue in the parent process using 'ipc_to_child' to communicate with
     * the child */
    do_parent_logic(ipc_to_child);

Note that these connection pairs can also be a useful way of handling process
termination that allow you to bypass signal handling altogether. If a child
process terminates, the connection between the pair will be broken and so this
will be noticed in the parent process by any selector selecting on the
B<ipc_to_child> connection - the subsequent NAL_CONNECTION_io() operation will
fail indicating that the child process is dead (or in the process of dying) and
so the parent could immediately call wait(2) or waitpid(2). Whether the SIGCHLD
signal arrives before the NAL_CONNECTION_io() call or not is not too important,
at worst it might prematurely interrupt NAL_SELECTOR_select() (causing it to
return zero) so that a redundant loop of the state-machine runs before the next
select operation will notice the disconnection. If you already need IPC between
the parent and child for exchange of data anyway, this mechanism could be
useful in avoiding global variables, signal handlers, and the associated
difficulties.
