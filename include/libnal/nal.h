 *                     XX *val);
 * and
 *   int NAL_encode_XX(unsigned char **bin, unsigned int *cnt,
 *                     const XX val);
 * where 'XX' is the primitive type in question. The behaviour is that bin &
 * bin_len are altered after the encoding/decoding so that bin points to the
 * next unused byte and bin_len is reduced by the number of bytes used. As such,
 * these functions can be used in situations where (i) the input may be
 * insufficient to encode or decode the relevant structure, and (ii) where
 * multiple levels of encoding/decoding may be constructed for aggregate
 * structure types.
 *
 * The return values are zero for failure and non-zero for success.
