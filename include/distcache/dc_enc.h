 * --------------
 * Message format
 * --------------
 *
 * Requests and responses use the same binary "message" format with the
 * distinction between operations being made in the message's data. However,
 * "proto_level" allows for this format to evolve over time (when NECESSARY!) by
 * performing a version check on the first 4 bytes of any request/response -
 * thus allowing cleaner error handling of version incompatibilites. The
 * DISTCACHE_PROTOCOL_VER symbol is used as the "proto_level" value by the
 * sender to indicate its protocol version (most-significant word) as well as
 * its patch level (least-significant word). The patch level isn't strictly
 * needed for assuring binary format compatibility of the protocol, but it can
 * help by allowing the possibility for more recent tools to be backwards
 * compatible with older versions. When a bug-fix or enhancement can not do
 * this, an incompatible bump in the protocol version is necessary.
 * 
 * For the current protocol version, 0x0010, each message is of this basic
 * format;
 *
 * unsigned long (4-bytes)              proto_level
 * unsigned char (1-byte)               is_response
 * unsigned long (4-bytes)              request_uid
 * unsigned char (1-byte)               op_class
 * unsigned char (1-byte)               operation
 * unsigned char (1-byte)               complete
 * unsigned int (2-bytes)               data_len    (max: DC_MSG_MAX_DATA)
 * unsigned char[] ('data_len' bytes)   data
 *
 * proto_level;
 *    A 32-bit version number for the protocol used by the sender for encoding
 *    the the message. See above for explanations.
 * is_response;
 *    There are two valid values; 0 -> the message is a request
 *                                1 -> the message is a response
 * request_uid;
 *    This value only has significance to the side initiating a request. It is
 *    simply used in response messages to allow the caller to match a response
 *    to its corresponding request.
 * op_class;
 *    Indicates which set of operations 'operation' should be interpreted in.
 *    "Normal" operations always set this to the 'DC_CLASS_USER' (zero).
 * operation;
 *    Given 'op_class', this value then defines the exact operation required by
 *    the side sending the request. It is what allows the side generating a
 *    response to interpret the meaning of the 'data'/'data_len' values.
 * complete;
 *    Many messages will not actually fully encode in a single DC_MSG structure.
 *    As such, this value can be used for "framing", all frames however must
 *    have the same request_uid and only the final one should be "complete";
 *            0 -> there is more data to come
 *            1 -> this is the final message.
 *    NB: To make the protocol more sturdy, each "incomplete" message must send
 *    DC_MSG_MAX_DATA bytes of data. Only the final message can send less.
 * data_len;
 *    This value indicates how many bytes are in the 'data_len' field that
 *    follows it. It allows multiple requests/responses to be concatenated one
 *    after another without ambiguity. To ensure dead-locks don't occur in the
 *    framing of these messages, 'data_len' has a maximum valid value of
 *    DC_MSG_MAX_DATA.
 * data;
 *    This is the "input" to a request and the "output" for a response. The
 *    length of the field depends on 'data_len', and the interpretation of this
 *    data depends on the choice of 'op_class'/'operation'.
 *
 * ------------------------------------
 * Classes of operations and their data
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 * The current list of operation classes and operations is as follows;
 *
 *   op_class              operation
 *   --------              ---------
 *   DC_CLASS_USER         DC_OP_ADD
 *                         DC_OP_GET
 *                         DC_OP_REMOVE
 *                         DC_OP_HAVE
 *
 * All operations can return a one-byte response which is to be interpreted as
 * an "error" value (in the case of "ADD", and "REMOVE" this includes an "OK"
 * value, and in the case of "HAVE" is a boolean anyway). These values, if
 * they're less than 100, come from the DC_ERR enumerate type. Otherwise, they
 * are from the per-operation enums corresponding to the command type. The
 * meaning of the operations and their data is as follows;
 *
 * DC_OP_ADD;
 *    This operation sends session data to a cache target for addition. The
 *    encoded data is prefixed by a 4-byte (unsigned long) value indicating the
 *    number of seconds the server should allow before automatically removing
 *    the session from its storage. Following that is a 4-byte value indicating
 *    the length of the session id. The rest of the payload data is the session
 *    id followed by the session data itself. The return value is 1-byte;
 *    either DC_ERR_OK, or a value chosen from DC_[ADD_]ERR_*** values.
 * DC_OP_GET;
 *    This operation looks up a cache target to see if it has the session
 *    corresponding to a given session id. The payload is the session id, and
 *    the return value is either a 1-byte error value chosen from the DC_ERR
 *    type or the session data matching the id.
 * DC_OP_REMOVE;
 *    This operation looks up a cache target to remove the session
 *    corresponding to a given session id. The payload is the session id, and
 *    the return value is a 1-byte error value chosen from DC_ERR_TYPE.
 * DC_OP_HAVE;
 *    This operation is like DC_OP_GET, except that it doesn't return session
 *    data if it has the session corresponding to the provided session id. The
 *    caller is simply wanting to know if the cache still has the session. The
 *    reason is for proxying code - downloading a session involves quite a bit
 *    of bandwidth - so proxies may alreay have the session cached but just
 *    want to check it hasn't been deleted from the server before they return
 *    it to an application. The format is the same as DC_OP_GET, and the return
 *    value is a 1-byte boolean value from chosen from the DC_ERR type (YES/NO
 *    is DC_ERR_OK/DC_ERR_NOTOK respectively).
