Installation
------------

For now, the compilation instructions are very straightforward.
 o Type "./configure"
 o Type "make"
 o Hope

As for installation, that's also rather easy.
 o As the root user, type "make install"

There is currently experimental support for producing source and binary RPM
packages. The ".spec" file for doing this is in the ./devel/ directory and
contains comments that can be read to get help with building RPMs.

Something more useful
---------------------

The current version of the code has the standard GNU autotools framework in
place already ("./configure" with all the normal supported options such as
"--prefix"), but there is quite likely some work required to have the code
*use* the facilities of the autotools for better portability, particularly in
the "libnal" networking code. If you have a target platform that has
compilation problems, please give us some information - if you can provide
fixes or allow us shell access to such a machine to fix it ourselves we would
be most grateful; please mail distcache-team@lists.sourceforge.net.

Before long, 'distcache' should be well supported on the standard Unix-like
platforms as well as Win32 (using Cygwin) because of the GNU autotools suite.
Please feel free to monitor ongoing development in CVS, and contributions are
always welcome!
