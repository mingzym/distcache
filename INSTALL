Installation
------------

For now, the compilation instructions are very straightforward.
 o Type "./configure"
 o Type "make"
 o Hope

As for installation, that's also rather easy.
 o As the root user, type "make install"

Note, there used to be some experimental ".spec" code for generating RPMS, but
this has been obsoleted. Already Redhat and Mandrake have RPM packaging for
distcache available (though whether these are in all variations or not is
unknown), and one should look to distribution vendors for properly integrated
packaging. In manual cases, the "./configure && make install" route is advised
as it will typically install in /usr/local/ to avoid smashing package-based
tools.

Something more useful
---------------------

The current version of the code has the standard GNU autotools framework in
place already ("./configure" with all the normal supported options such as
"--prefix"), but there is quite likely some work required to have the code
*use* the facilities of the autotools for better portability, particularly in
the "libnal" networking code. If you have a target platform that has
compilation problems, please give us some information - if you can provide
fixes or allow us shell access to such a machine to fix it ourselves we would
be most grateful; please mail distcache-team@lists.sourceforge.net.

Before long, 'distcache' should be well supported on the standard Unix-like
platforms as well as Win32 (using Cygwin) because of the GNU autotools suite.
Please feel free to monitor ongoing development in CVS, and contributions are
always welcome!
