Installation
------------

For now, the compilation instructions are very straightforward.
 o Type "make"
 o Hope

As for installation, that's also rather easy.
 o Use 'cp' or 'mv'


Something more useful
---------------------

Now that 'distcache' is open source, some efforts are being made to support it
using the GNU autotools. The code, prior to being released as open source, was
made to work on the required platforms on a case-by-case basis (by scripts in
the "NotLinux" directory that would patch the build system). Likewise, packaging
and installation was handled externally to the source tree.

Before long, 'distcache' should be well supported on the standard Unix-like
platforms as well as Win32 (using Cygwin) because of the GNU autotools suite.
Please feel free to monitor ongoing development in CVS, and contributions are
always welcome!
