Current version: xx.xx

Changes between 0.1-seed and xx.xx
----------------------------------

  *) [Steve Robb]
  
     Add the first part of autoconf/autmake/libtool support to distcache
     including numerous followup tweaks.

  *) [Geoff Thorpe]

     Use the autoconf-generated config.h to control #includes.

     Removed various things from 0.1-seed that aren't relevant;
     - IN_MAKEDEPEND hacks no longer needed as autoconf/automake handle
       dependencies.
     - wrapper functions removed for unneeded stuff, fork(), waitpid(), etc.
     - NAL_SELECTOR_create() removed too.
     - NAL types are always dynamic now, so init() functions aren't needed to
       initialise static versions.
     - Get rid of some unnecessary types and use just DC_ERR where possible
       (this altered the protocol slightly).

     Add "-pidfile" and "-daemon" switches to the 'sserver' utility.

     Allow building without OpenSSL support (only affects test_session which
     can generate garbage sessions to test with rather than OpenSSL-compatible
     ones).

     Added a self-test script to test sserver and sclient with test_session.

     Added DISTCACHE_CLIENT_API and DISTCACHE_CLIENT_BINARY version defines to
     dc_client.h so that apache/mod_ssl plugins can run sanity checks on the
     version of distcache.
