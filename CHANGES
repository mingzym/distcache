Version notes
-------------

The seed code to distcache was derived from commercial code belonging to
Cryptographic Appliances who gave permission for it to be open-sourced under an
LGPL license. Upon importing this code, an initial "0.1-seed" release will be
made to allow the code to be easily downloaded for those wanting to take a look
without requiring a CVS checkout. This version will provide no promise of
network interoperability with future versions as versioning had not been
integrated into the protocol at that point.


Current version: 0.1-seed
