Version notes
-------------

The seed code to discache was derived from commercial code belonging to
Cryptographic Appliances who gave permission for it to be open sourced under an
LGPL license. Upon importing this code, an initial "0.1-seed" release will be
made to allow the code to be easily downloaded for those wanting to take a look
without requiring a CVS checkout. This version will provide no promise of
network interoperability with future versions as versioning had not been
integrated into the protocol at that point.


Current version: 0.1-seed
