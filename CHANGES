Current version: xx.xx
----------------------


Changes between 0.2 and xx.xx
-----------------------------

  *) Rename "test_session" to "dc_test" to keep with the naming convention
     for all utilities.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Tidy up the "bootstrap.sh" script and add support for two built-in gcc
     configurations. If the PRECONF environment variable is set, then the
     bootstrap script will automatically invoke "./configure" with preset
     CFLAGS. The two built-in options are PRECONF=[gcc-RELEASE|gcc-DEBUG].
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Add two switches to test_session to allow controlling the size of session
     data when generating sample sessions manually. This doesn't apply in the
     OpenSSL case, but I have disabled the use of OpenSSL in test_session too
     as it wasn't terribly useful and adds complexity to the build system.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Fix a "flushing" bug in libdistcache that would occasionally not fully
     advance the state-machine of a "plug" in either the read or write
     direction.  This occurred when a connection's read or write buffer
     contained data for more than one fragment of message - sometimes a
     subsequent fragment would not be pulled (or pushed) through, leading to
     occasional hangs in a select() waiting for traffic that has already been
     received. This should finally mark the end of the "works for a while then
     hangs" problems we were seeing.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Add a helper program, "dc_snoop", to act as a transparent proxy. When a
     client connects, a corresponding peer connection is set up to the
     configured back-end server and data is transparently proxied back and
     forth - meanwhile it is analysed and various information can be displayed
     to the console.
     [Geoff Thorpe]
  
  *) Correct some comments, and make sure *all* code agrees on a fragmentation
     size of 2048 for messages broken into fragments. This affects binary
     compatibility with 0.2, but 0.2 was (in some cases) broken in this respect
     anyway. In any case, the protocol version is bumped to ensure subsequent
     versions don't try to talk to older versions.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) A variety of changes to libnal
     - get rid of unused (and horrible) NAL_***_move() functions,
     - change a miniscule helper function to a more readable macro,
     - re-organise the helper macros into their own section of code,
     - Consolidate the malloc/free code with the init/finish code as
       malloc/free is the only mechanism declared in the libnal API,
     - improve parameter checking,
     - improve some logic such that a structure's elements are only
       changed if success of the function is guaranteed - makes error-handling
       easier,
     - regard accepted connections as automatically "established" even
       if they are non-blocking.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Avoid more "statement will never be executed" and signed/unsigned
     warnings. Use "do { ... } while(0)" bracings in the libnal typesafe
     macros.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Fixed two nasty bugs caused by uninitialised structure elements in
     sessclient. Thanks to valgrind.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Make some macros in libnal/common.h more robust against semi-colons, or
     expressions being used as parameters. Also, clarify and simplify some
     timeval handling in libnal/sys.c.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Fixed some "cached_idx" nastiness found in libdistcacheserver where -1,
     which was used to indicate "nothing cached", was not being checked and
     instead populated into an unsigned integer as a valid index. Also fixed
     some weird-looking code found during the bug-hunt.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Fix the "ISO C89 compiler" warnings about string constants longer than 509
     characters by re-declaring them as arrays of strings. This means the
     utility programs display their usage messages by displaying each string in
     the array separated by newlines.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Remove unexecutable code, and correct some more signed/unsigned
     mismatches.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Indent #error directives (so "traditional" C pre-compilers ignore them)
     and unindent any #define directives (so the same pre-compilers don't
     ignore them).
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Some signed/unsigned mismatches were causing integer variables, that use
     -1 as a special case, to be munged and not treated as negative. This was
     causing some array smashing and other weirdness.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Fixed include paths in automake so that any build directory, different to
     the source-tree itself, can be used by running;
         /path/to/distcache/configure --srcdir=/path/to/distcache ...
     [Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>]

  *) If the build system contains pkg-config, use that to establish compiler
     and linker flags for building against OpenSSL.
     [Joe Orton <jorton@redhat.com>]

  *) Re-order some autoconf checks, eg. check library/linkage first so that
     additional linker flags (such as "-lnsl -lsocket" on Solaris) are
     available before we check for specific functions.
     [Steve Robb]

  *) Extend NAL_daemon() for platforms that don't provide the daemon(3)
     function (eg. Solaris) by implementing our own fallback version.
     [John Milton <john.milton@fxfn.com> and Steve Robb]

  *) Upgrade the mod_ssl (apache 1.3.*) support to mod_ssl-2.8.12
     [Steve Robb]

  *) Change the name of the executables "sclient" and "sserver" to "dc_client"
     and "dc_server" to avoid name-clashes with the Kerberos distribution.
     [John Milton <john.milton@fxfn.com> and Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Add a demo client certificate (taken from my "tunala" demo in OpenSSL) for
     use in "test_session" when generating sample sessions containing peer-
     certificates.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

Changes between 0.1-seed and 0.2
--------------------------------

  *) Altered the binary protocol used by distcache to begin each message with a
     32-bit protocol level. The top 16-bit word of this is a "protocol value"
     which must be identical for peers to interoperate (though a server with a
     higher value could respond to the first request by adopting the peer's
     protocol). The lower 16-bit word is a "patch level" which allows the more
     recent of two peers to decide if it should accept communications or not
     with the peer (and work around older bugs if necessary).
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Added DISTCACHE_CLIENT_API and DISTCACHE_CLIENT_BINARY version defines to
     dc_client.h so that apache/mod_ssl plugins can run sanity checks on the
     version of distcache.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Allow building without OpenSSL support (only affects test_session which
     can generate garbage sessions to test with rather than OpenSSL-compatible
     ones).
     [Geoff Thorpe, Steve Robb]

  *) Add "-pidfile" and "-daemon" switches to the 'sserver' utility.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Added a self-test script to test sserver and sclient with test_session.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Removed various things from 0.1-seed that aren't relevant;
     - IN_MAKEDEPEND hacks no longer needed as autoconf/automake handle
       dependencies.
     - wrapper functions removed for unneeded stuff, fork(), waitpid(), etc.
     - NAL_SELECTOR_create() removed too.
     - NAL types are always dynamic now, so init() functions aren't needed to
       initialise static versions.
     - Get rid of some unnecessary types and use just DC_ERR where possible
       (this altered the protocol slightly).
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Use the autoconf-generated config.h to control #includes.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Add the first part of autoconf/automake/libtool support to distcache
     including numerous followup tweaks.
     [Steve Robb]
