Current version: xx.xx

Changes between 0.2 and xx.xx

  *)

Changes between 0.1-seed and 0.2
--------------------------------

  *) Altered the binary protocol used by distcache to begin each message with a
     32-bit protocol level. The top 16-bit word of this is a "protocol value"
     which must be identical for peers to interoperate (though a server with a
     higher value could respond to the first request by adopting the peer's
     protocol). The lower 16-bit word is a "patch level" which allows the more
     recent of two peers to decide if it should accept communications or not
     with the peer (and work around older bugs if necessary).
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Added DISTCACHE_CLIENT_API and DISTCACHE_CLIENT_BINARY version defines to
     dc_client.h so that apache/mod_ssl plugins can run sanity checks on the
     version of distcache.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Allow building without OpenSSL support (only affects test_session which
     can generate garbage sessions to test with rather than OpenSSL-compatible
     ones).
     [Geoff Thorpe, Steve Robb]

  *) Add "-pidfile" and "-daemon" switches to the 'sserver' utility.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Added a self-test script to test sserver and sclient with test_session.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Removed various things from 0.1-seed that aren't relevant;
     - IN_MAKEDEPEND hacks no longer needed as autoconf/automake handle
       dependencies.
     - wrapper functions removed for unneeded stuff, fork(), waitpid(), etc.
     - NAL_SELECTOR_create() removed too.
     - NAL types are always dynamic now, so init() functions aren't needed to
       initialise static versions.
     - Get rid of some unnecessary types and use just DC_ERR where possible
       (this altered the protocol slightly).
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Use the autoconf-generated config.h to control #includes.
     [Geoff Thorpe]

  *) Add the first part of autoconf/automake/libtool support to distcache
     including numerous followup tweaks.
     [Steve Robb]
