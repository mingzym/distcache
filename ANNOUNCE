distcache release: 0.2
----------------------

We are pleased to announce the release of version 0.2 of the distcache package.
For more information on what distcache is and how to use it, please see the
README as it provides a good introduction and a guide to the other documents in
this package.

This release introduces GNU autotools into distcache's build system, namely
autoconf, automake, and libtool. This should make building and package
maintenance of distcache more familiar to users of other GNU-style packages.
However, a few critical parts of distcache do not yet adequately use autoconf
support to aid portability, so some feedback is encouraged if you have a system
environment we can better support than we do right now.

Version 0.2 is the first release made since the initial seed code (with only
minor tidy-ups) was released as version "0.1-seed", so this represents the first
release with active development from the distcache project itself. A basic
version control mechanism has been introduced into distcache's binary protocol,
and the aforementioned GNU autotools support has replaced the build system.
Apart from that, most change since 0.1-seed consists of bug-fixes and code
re-organisation. Please check the CHANGES file for more detail.

Thanks for trying out distcache!
