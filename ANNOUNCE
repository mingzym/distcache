distcache release: 0.1-seed
---------------------------

The seed code to distcache was derived from commercial code belonging to
Cryptographic Appliances who gave permission for it to be open-sourced under an
LGPL license. This 0.1-seed release is to allow this initial code to be reviewed
and tested by those who have an interest in distributed session caching, eg. for
SSL/TLS.

More information can be found from the README (and the other files that the
README document refers to), but one important note needs to be made about this
release - there should be no expectation, implied or construed, that the
protocol implemented in this release will interoperate with any future distcache
release. Version checking and other handshaking measures are currently being
reviewed to ensure that successive versions can properly interoperate with one
another (or gracefully refuse with version-related diagnositcs) - but simply the
introduction of such measures will break interoperability with the protocol
implemented in this 0.1-seed release.

In short, this is a proof-of-concept release.

Please bookmark the distcache home page and check back from time to time, and/or
subscribe to one or more of the email lists mentioned on the site;

The distcache project is hosted by SourceForge.net, and as such provides a full
range of additional services. Please feel free to take a browse :-)

Thanks for trying out distcache!
