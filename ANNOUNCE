distcache release: 0.3
----------------------

We are pleased to announce the release of version 0.3 of the distcache package.
For more information on what distcache is and how to use it, please see the
README as it provides a good introduction and a guide to the other documents in
this package.

The main changes in version 0.3 are predominantly bug-fixes of glitches that
were found in 0.2 under various conditions. However, a new tool "dc_snoop" has
also been introduced that acts as a transparent proxy to monitors distcache
protocol traffic passing through it. Also, the existing tools have been renamed
for consistency and to avoid name-clashes with the Kerberos distribution. Ie.
{"sserver", "sclient", and "test_session"} have become {"dc_server",
"dc_client", and "dc_test"}.

This release is being labelled "alpha". This is an improvement from the
"pre-alpha" state that we used in prior releases, but should still indicate
that we are fishing for bugs and auditing and would like to see some mileage
before we go "beta" or "stable".
