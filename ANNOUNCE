distcache release: 1.4.4
------------------------

We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.4.4 of the distcache
package. For more information on what distcache is and how to use it, please
see the README as it provides a good introduction and a guide to the other
documents in this package.

This is the fourth release of distcache from the 1.x branch of development.
This branch incorporates the "sslswamp" SSL/TLS benchmarking utility (which
used to be known simply as "swamp" and was maintained separately to distcache),
and this release corrects a couple of build problems in 1.4.3. This branch of
development is currently considered of "beta" quality, though should be pretty
stable nonetheless.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please bookmark the distcache home page and check back from time to time, and/or
subscribe to one or more of the email lists mentioned on the site;
    http://www.distcache.org/

The distcache project is hosted by SourceForge.net, and as such provides a full
range of additional services. Please feel free to take a browse :-)

Thanks for trying out distcache!
